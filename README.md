# Grazioso Salvare Animal Rescue Dashboard

*The Grazioso Salvare Animal Rescue Dashboard is a comprehensive, interactive web application designed to help identify and categorize dogs suitable for search-and-rescue training. This full-stack dashboard application integrates with MongoDB databases to provide real-time filtering, visualization, and mapping capabilities for animal shelter data. The dashboard enables rescue organizations to efficiently identify candidate animals based on specific rescue type criteria including water rescue, mountain/wilderness rescue, and disaster/individual tracking operations.*

## Motivation

*Animal rescue organizations need efficient tools to identify suitable candidates for specialized training programs. Traditional methods of manually searching through large datasets are time-consuming and prone to errors. This project was created to streamline the process of identifying rescue-suitable animals by providing an interactive, user-friendly dashboard that automatically filters and visualizes animal shelter data based on scientific rescue training criteria. The dashboard reduces the time required to identify suitable candidates from hours to minutes while ensuring consistent application of rescue type specifications. This standardized approach improves the efficiency of rescue animal identification and supports better decision-making for training program coordinators.*

## Getting Started

*This dashboard connects to a MongoDB database named "AAC" with a collection called "animals" containing Austin Animal Center outcomes data. The database contains 10,000+ animal records with comprehensive information including breeds, ages, sex, outcomes, and geolocation data. The dashboard requires a MongoDB user account called "aacuser" with readWrite permissions to the AAC database for secure data access.*

*The dashboard implements four main filtering categories based on Grazioso Salvare's rescue training specifications: Water Rescue (Labrador Retriever Mix, Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Newfoundland - Intact Females, 26-156 weeks), Mountain/Wilderness Rescue (German Shepherd, Alaskan Malamute, Old English Sheepdog, Siberian Husky, Rottweiler - Intact Males, 26-156 weeks), Disaster/Individual Tracking (Doberman Pinscher, German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, Bloodhound, Rottweiler - Intact Males, 20-300 weeks), and Reset functionality to view all available animals.*

*The main challenges encountered included implementing complex multi-field MongoDB queries, handling inconsistent geolocation data, ensuring real-time synchronization between dashboard components, and optimizing performance for large datasets. These challenges were overcome by developing robust query structures using MongoDB operators, implementing comprehensive error handling with fallback coordinates, creating a sophisticated callback architecture for component synchronization, and utilizing pagination and data optimization techniques for improved performance.*

## Installation

The following tools and libraries are required to use this software:

**MongoDB**: NoSQL database system chosen for its flexibility in handling complex animal shelter data with varying attributes and its powerful query capabilities for multi-field filtering operations.

  # CS-340 Portfolio Reflection

## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Writing maintainable code requires modular design and clear documentation. In the CRUD Python module from Project One, I created separate methods for each database operation with comprehensive error handling, making the code easy to test and modify. The modular design allowed me to easily connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two without rewriting database logic. This CRUD module could be adapted for future projects like inventory management systems or customer databases by simply changing the connection parameters and extending the base class.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach problems systematically by analyzing requirements before implementation. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I first understood the client's need to identify rescue dogs based on specific criteria, then designed the database queries and user interface to meet those requirements efficiently. This project differed from previous coursework because it required thinking like a consultant working with real client needs rather than just completing technical exercises. For future database projects, I would use similar techniques: thorough requirements analysis, iterative development with client feedback, and designing for scalability from the beginning.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve real-world problems by creating technological solutions that improve efficiency and decision-making. My dashboard transforms a manual process that could take hours into an automated system that identifies suitable rescue animals in seconds, allowing organizations to focus on training rather than data management. This type of work matters because it makes complex technology accessible to domain experts who can apply it to solve important problems, ultimately improving rescue operations and potentially saving more lives through better efficiency.
